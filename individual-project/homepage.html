                        <h3>Enriching Life Through Science</h3>
                        <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration focuses on keeping the public informed of the changing environment around them, and what they can do to help it. The NOAA strives to conserve and manage coastal and marine ecosystems and resources. In June, 2019, the NOAA conducted their annual Sea Turtle Week which is a week designated to celebrating these animals. This most recent Sea Turtle Week focused on how we can use science to help save threatened and endangered sea turtles. Some examples of the NOAA’s conservation efforts are: their work studying sea turtle “fingerprints” to study their DNA and learn more information about their species, illuminating nets with LED lights to see if increasing net visibility reduces bycatch, using satellite tags to track female sea turtles to be able to see where they migrate to lay eggs, and much more.
